# AudicaChainFixer
 A mod to fix broken chains

This mod will remove any chains that softlocks the game. Currently this part of the mod doesn't work.

You can set the chain line to be a specefic color for each hand, or your hand colors, or just default black byt zeroing all values in the config file.
